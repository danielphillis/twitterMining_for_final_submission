the pickle files here must be located in a subfolder called "pickle_files"
relative to the Sent_Analysis python file 
for the python to be able to acces the data in the pickle files

ie
directory contents:
-------------------
python_script.py 
pickle_files (folder containing the several pickle files)

Alternatively the path can be modified in the python script
for each open command opening the pickle files
